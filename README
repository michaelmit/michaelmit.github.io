Assignment 1: Your Portfolio
Mithun T. Michael



1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented 
   and what have not.
   I have submitted all documents as per grading rubric.
   Resume is styled. Bio does not have content.
   I prefer to keep my bio/picture/resume private from search engines,
   and reveal only to those I choose by providing a link. Can I do this?


2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
   I worked on this assignment on my own.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
   I spent approx. 3 hours watching online videos, tutorials on HTML/CSS. Then,
   4 hours on this assignment. I feel I need to still spend more time studying
   good design practices.
