1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented

   I'd like to fill out my resume and bio.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
   I worked on this assignment on my own.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

   2-3 hours on this assignment.
